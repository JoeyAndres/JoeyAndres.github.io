      <h1 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h1><p>With my <a href="https://github.com/JoeyAndres/sdm" target="_blank" rel="external">Sparse Distributed Memory (SDM)</a> basic implementation finally done, in which the <a href="https://joeyandres.github.io/2016/12/10/sdm-addressing-the-up-down-counter-overflow/" target="_blank" rel="external">Up/Down Counters won’t overflow</a>, I’m ready to embark something bigger. At the moment, my implementation stores everything in random-access-memory (RAM), which is very limiting. I have utilize SDM with my <a href="https://github.com/JoeyAndres/rl" target="_blank" rel="external">reinforcement learning (rl)</a>, solving entailments in a set of 11,000 metrics, which occupies all my 16gb of ram. This is not ideal since, even with SDM, there are many collisions, granted they are better than random hashing collision provided by <em>Tile Coding.</em> Also, I can only do machine learning on a smaller and sparse set of data, due to the space. To amend all of this, it is clear what the next step is. Utilize database systems.</p>
<h1 id="The-Plan"><a href="#The-Plan" class="headerlink" title="The Plan"></a>The Plan</h1><p>Since all the “bottleneck” stems from the space requirements of the <em>Up/Down Counters</em>, it makes sense to somehow store all that stuff in database. For a quick review of what <em>Up/Down Counters </em>look like, see the figure below.</p>
<img src="/2016/12/11/sdm-and-database-part-1-planning/image_0.png" alt="SDM Structure Image" title="SDM Structure Image">
<p>What I want is to store each row in database.</p>
<img src="/2016/12/11/sdm-and-database-part-1-planning/image_1.png" alt="Saving row to database" title="Saving row to database">
<p>Considering that <em>Up/Down</em> <em>Counters</em> row represents a feature vector which is probably not that big, this might be sufficient. Problem occurs if the feature vector is actually huge, then we probably need a smarter way of segmenting each row into cells.</p>
<img src="/2016/12/11/sdm-and-database-part-1-planning/image_2.png" alt="Saving chunks to database" title="Saving chunks to database">
<p>Now we are more robust, allowing us to store bigger data. One thing to note is that storing each row will be faster, due to less “context-switching” when switching to another db entry. Cell solution can do the same by setting the <em>column width</em> to something equal to the size of data. Our final schema is represented by the image below.</p>
<img src="/2016/12/11/sdm-and-database-part-1-planning/image_3.png" alt="Schema" title="Schema">
<ul>
<li><p>Each <em>UpDownCounter</em> instance have a db entry.</p>
<ul>
<li>Contains the size of each row, <em>DataSize</em>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Each <em>UpDownCounter</em> instance have many associated <em>Cell</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Contains the <em>ChunkSize</em> of the cell. Although can be saved in <em>UpDownCounter</em>, imagine, having some cell bigger than the other. This should allow for that possibility, although I don’t intend to use it (I don’t mind the redundancy that much).</p>
</li>
<li><p>And the data itself, <em>BinData.</em></p>
</li>
<li><p>The <em>row, col</em> stores where this cell is located.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Choosing-A-Database"><a href="#Choosing-A-Database" class="headerlink" title="Choosing A Database"></a>Choosing A Database</h1><p>Since I don’t intend to uphold the CAP theorem, that is, the possibility of SDM incrementing the same counter at the same time should be possible, and I want horizontal scalability, I must choose one of the NoSQL database. I’ve looked at MongoDB and it’s <em>C++ </em>client (Note, my SDM implementation is in C++) and have found it difficult to build and install. I’ve also looked at Cassandra and it seems like a better fit for my problem. It was easy, way faster, and way scalable.</p>
<h1 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h1><p>That’s it! We are done. See you in part 2 when I have a basic working implementation of this.</p>

      <h1 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h1><p>Sparse Distributed Memory (SDM) is a fascinating way of managing exponential growth in memory. As opposed to the traditional random-access memory (RAM) where there is a one to one correspondence between an address and a <em>hard location, </em>SDM can map multiple address to a multiple of <em>hard location</em>. I won’t delve into why this is useful, I suggest reading Mr. Kanerva’s paper, <em>A Cerebellar-Model Associative Memory As A Generalized Random-Access Memory</em>, which I believe is available in IEEE. The purpose of this article is to discuss the shortcoming of writing data in SDM and an amendment from Reinforcement Learning community.</p>
<h1 id="SDM-Write-Read-operations"><a href="#SDM-Write-Read-operations" class="headerlink" title="SDM Write/Read operations"></a>SDM Write/Read operations</h1><p>Before we delve on addressing the shortcoming, let us quickly review on how the SDM <em>write/read</em> operation works. The figure below is taken from Mr. Kanerva’s paper mentioned above. Again, this is just a quick summary of the <em>write/read</em> operations, thus if lost, consult the paper. </p>
<p>In the paper, it describes the writing of <em>1011001010</em> and then <em>0101010110 </em>to the SDM. Prior to any operations in SDM, the<em> Up/Down Counters</em> or the data storage itself are all zeros. For the first insertion, <em>1011001010</em> activated 3 address register in which its Hamming Distance is less than or equal 3. This then updates each cell in activated/selected rows in <em>Up/Down Counters</em>. For instance, all columns aligned to the <em>1s</em> in <em>1011001010</em> are all incremented by one, and all columns aligned to <em>0s</em> are decremented.</p>
<img src="/2016/12/10/sdm-addressing-the-up-down-counter-overflow/image_0.png" alt="SDM Writing operation" title="SDM Writing operation">
<p>Similar operations occurred for second insertion, <em>0101010110</em> but different rows due to different hamming distance less than or equal three are activated.</p>
<p>Reading is by summing all the activated columns. For instance, reading the data addressed by <em>0101010110</em> is through summing all the activated columns, resulting in (<em>-3, -5, -3, 5, 5, 3, -3, 3, -3, 3). </em>The sum is finally converted to bits, assigning 0 if the sum of a column is negative, whilst 1 if otherwise. So in our case this is: <em>0001110101</em>.</p>
<img src="/2016/12/10/sdm-addressing-the-up-down-counter-overflow/image_1.png" alt="SDM Reading operation" title="SDM Reading operation">
<h1 id="Problem-with-SDM-Writing"><a href="#Problem-with-SDM-Writing" class="headerlink" title="Problem with SDM Writing"></a>Problem with SDM Writing</h1><p>Now suppose each cell in <em>Up/Down Counter</em> is represented by a 64bit signed integer (to allow for negatives) in a 64bit machine, thus occupying exactly one memory cell. Then there is a scenario in which after 264. Although this may seem like a super worst-case, it’s an overflow we’d rather not have. I have been reading unmentioned implementation and one of it have a <em>try/catch</em> or an <em>if/else</em> guard, considering these write operations happens a lot, this is a significant overhead.</p>
<h1 id="Solution-1-Geometric-Series"><a href="#Solution-1-Geometric-Series" class="headerlink" title="Solution 1: Geometric Series"></a>Solution 1: Geometric Series</h1><p>So our problem is integer overflow. How do we solve this? We want something that is something with a horizontal asymptote, something that slows growing as it approaches a value, all to avoid the overflow.</p>
<p>Geometric series have the following form:</p>
<img src="/2016/12/10/sdm-addressing-the-up-down-counter-overflow/image_2.png" alt="Geometric series" title="Geometric series">
<p>Where <em>a </em>is the initial value, I usually set this to 1 and <em>r </em>is the common ratio. As you can see above, the sum of geometric series is:</p>
<img src="/2016/12/10/sdm-addressing-the-up-down-counter-overflow/image_3.png" alt="Geometric series sum." title="Geometric series sum.">
<p>If <em>r</em> is set to |r| &lt; 1, then the series converges or “hits” a horizontal asymptote. So how is this useful as a replacement for integers in <em>Up/Down Counters</em>?</p>
<p>Imagine each cell in <em>Up/Down Counters</em> is a double (64bit floating point), <em>a=1, and |r| &lt; 1 </em>(again so we converge), how do we utilized Geometric Series’ converging nature? </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Let <strong>R</strong> be the current value of a cell.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Let <strong>R’ </strong>be the next value of the same cell.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So we acquired <strong>R</strong> in our nth update. Since it is a geometric series where <em>a=1, and |r| &lt; 1</em>. </p>
<p>R = 1 + r + … + rn</p>
<p>This is not very useful since it assumes we keep track of integer <em>n</em> which defeats the purpose. How can we make a recurrence relationship, that is, how do we get <strong>R’ </strong>from <strong>R</strong>? Continuing from formula above:</p>
<p>R = 1 + r + … + rn</p>
<p>R’ = 1 + r + … + rn + rn+1</p>
<p>R’ = 1 + (r + … + rn) x r</p>
<p><strong>R’ = 1 + R x r</strong></p>
<p>To generalize <em>a=1</em>,</p>
<p><strong>R’ = a + R x r</strong></p>
<p>That’s it. That is how we increment our cell in <em>Up/Down Counter.</em> Are we done? How do we decrement?</p>
<h1 id="Solution-2-From-Reinforcement-Learning"><a href="#Solution-2-From-Reinforcement-Learning" class="headerlink" title="Solution 2: From Reinforcement Learning"></a>Solution 2: From Reinforcement Learning</h1><p>To solve the decrement problem above, we’ll introduce an equation from Reinforcement Learning, specifically, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State-Action-Reward-State-Action" target="_blank" rel="external">SARSA</a>.</p>
<img src="/2016/12/10/sdm-addressing-the-up-down-counter-overflow/image_4.png" alt="SARSA Update Equation" title="SARSA Update Equation">
<p>To quickly summarize (you can skip if you want) SARSA, (st, at) is the state-action pair. Q(st, at) is what we are trying to update base on the current observed reward of the next state Q(st+1, at+1). Step-size α controls how fast Q(st, at) learns or converge while 𝛄 dictates how influential future states are. Basically, by shifting rt+1 + 𝛄Q(st+1, at+1) to something greater than Q(st, at), Q(st, at) will be incremented and vice-versa. There lies the idea behind our final solution. If you decompose the equation above, you’ll also unravel a geometric series.</p>
<p>If you don’t care about the SARSA equation above, it’s fine. Basically it allows us to increment/decrement. To make build our final solution, simply replace Q(st, at) as <strong>R</strong>, or the floating point we are trying to update in our <em>Up/Down counter </em>cell.</p>
<p><strong>R &lt;- R + r[1 - R], </strong> <em>for increment</em></p>
<p><strong>R &lt;- R + r[-1 - R], </strong> <em>for decrement</em></p>
<p>Done! All I can say is shift your common-ratio/step-size to a really small value so you won’t converge quickly. Maybe change <strong>1</strong> to something bigger for the same reason. Other than that, NO MORE OVERFLOW!</p>
<h1 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h1><p>Truth be told that the update formula from Reinforcement Learning is not unique. It is everywhere in machine learning literature such as <em>Perceptron Learning Rule</em> and the ever more popular <em>Linear Regression.</em> I just really love Reinforcement Learning that’s why I want to nudge it in.</p>
