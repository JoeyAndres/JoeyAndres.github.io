# Hello All,

I'm  Joey Andres. I always love working on things mechanical in nature, may it be hardware or software. My primary interest is Artificial Intelligence but I've been around. Explored the rabbit holes of Meteor, Angular, and Node. Even created a Meteor frontend framework that gathered a few support. Also played with Moodle LMS for some work.
 
Concerning my current work, I'm currently working on [rl](https://github.com/JoeyAndres/rl) and [sdm](https://github.com/JoeyAndres/sparse-distributed-memory). The former is a reinforcement learning library, while the latter is a _sparse distributed system_ to managed the multi-dimensional problems in reinforcement learning. I'm hoping to make a mark here.

I have a lot of future plans. But I'll keep them secret to avoid jinxing myself.
